# Cloud Photo Migrator

A script that will parse, modify and update a Google Photos archive for upload to another photo library. The intention is to apply the metadata that Google Photos stores separately in their archive to the media, so that your photo library remains chronological across clouds.

## Usage

The script is still modified to become more user friendly. Once this is completed, this section will be updated with detailed instructions.

## Media Support

Currently, the following media files are supported by the script. All other files will remain in the `media` & `data` folders.

### Images

- `jpg`

### Video

- `mp4`

### Other

-

## Contributions

If you would like to add support for other media types, or any other improvements, please submit a pull request. I'd be happy to receive your support.
